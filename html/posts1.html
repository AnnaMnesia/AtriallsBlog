                All we have to go from the trailer is that Redfall is a game
                about a bunch of misfits using their guns and weird powers
                against a horde of cultists and vampires. But boy did Arkane

                All four of the playable characters have cool designs and
                superpowers: there’s the lass with psychic powers that calls on
                a spectral elevator to launch friends into the sky, a
                sharpshooter with a raven friend, a nerd with a gatling gun
                filled with stakes, and a techie with a tiny robot friend. They
                make an immediate first impression and we can’t wait to see
                more.

                Year in, year out, games – via Steam and otherwise – are
                produced in such varying degrees of quality that not a single
                one of them is destined for certain success. Masterpieces are
                released alongside utter disasters, series are born while others
                dwindle and, occasionally, a game actually lives up to our
                expectations. Below you’ll find the upcoming PC games you should
                keep on your radar, as well as their expected release dates.

              <p>
                A brand new game from Sonic Team has been announced, and it’s
                coming to PC. Sonic Frontiers is an open-world action adventure
                game set on the Starfall Islands. We don’t know anything more
                yet, but we’re preparing a batch of chili dogs in anticipation.
              </p>
              <h4>Sonic Frontiers release date: Late November 8, 2022</h4>

              <p>
                Besides the Facebook announcement from GSC Game World owner
                Sergiy Grygorovych that STALKER 2 is in development, we know
                barely anything about the upcoming survival horror sequel. All
                we have is an

                with a few trailers. This isn’t the first time the game has been
                in production, but fingers crossed everything goes swimmingly
                this time.

              <h2>The Outlast Trials</h2>
              <p>
                The Outlast Trials lets you share the terror of being hunted by
                sledgehammer-wielding brutes with friends. This time you’re not
                investigating a hospital, instead you and your pals are human
                guinea pigs in experiments being run by the Murkoff Corporation.
                Oh, and you can forget all about carrying a camcorder with you
                everywhere for night vision, instead the chaps at Murkoff have
                drilled night vision goggles directly into your skull. You lucky
                thing.

              <h2>Suicide Squad: Kill the justice league</h2>
              <p>
                We’ve been wondering what Batman Arkham developer Rocksteady is
                up to for years and now we finally have our answer: a Suicide
                Squad game. We can’t say it’s the game we were hoping for, but
                Rocksteady has done a terrific job with the Batman license so
                we’re quietly confident. There are no real details in the
                Suicide Squad game reveal, but the studio teased more details at
                the August 22 DC Fandome event.

                Ubisoft’s upcoming arena shooter will see 6v6 teams of
                ‘Defiants’ duke it out, using customised loadouts and powerful
                abilities unique to the ‘faction’ you choose. You can change
                your loadout each time you respawn, so you can adapt to the
                fast-paced battles as they develop. The game will be
                free-to-play, and recently dropped the Tom Clancy brand.

              <h2>Diablo 4</h2>
              <p>
                At long last, we’ve got some confirmation on Diablo 4. We always
                knew it would be coming, really, but getting a look at it is
                exciting. We know that the Druid class is coming back to join
                the roster of Diablo 4 classes, and we enjoyed our playtime with
                it at Blizzcon. Plus, it looks like there will be plenty of
                scope for creative Diablo 4 builds, especially with the reveal
                that Mythic items will be available.
              </p>
              <p>
                Details are dripping out right now – there will be an open-world
                setting, and Blizzard has plans for extensive player
                customization. That said, the game still boasts the same balance
                of lootin’ and dungeon dwelling that fans have come to adore. We
                may be waiting until 2023 for this one, though.
              </p>
