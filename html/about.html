                <p>My deep passion for video games</p>
              </div>
              <h3>Self Discovery?</h3>
              <p>My problem is I love video games. lol It’s silly but that’s what it is. I don’t just play a game and immediately hate it. And if I do, that is an incredibly rare occasion. Of course there are things I might not like about a game. Maybe the controls are bad, maybe the graphics aren’t as impressive as I think they should be, maybe a level was tedious and boring, maybe the story is bland. There are many things I might not like about a game, but that doesn’t stop me from enjoying it for the good things it has and loving it for it.</p>
              <h3>“That Game Sucks”</h3>
              <p>I often end up in arguments with people over video games. Mostly over whether or not they “suck.” This is something I find myself getting into more often than I’d like. I didn’t realize what was happening, I never understood why I kept finding myself in this predicament, why everyone wanted to argue with me or of course vice versa.</p>
              <p>I know I’m a stubborn person, or can be anyways, but I was still very confused. After years and years of this kind of interaction with fellow gamers I think I’ve finally come to a small understanding, I hope so anyways.</p>
              
              <h3>The Casual Gamer</h3>
              <p>That said, I do not consider puzzle games and social games “real” games. These are casual pastimes. People seem to get offended when I or other gamers make this kind of reference. I’m not attempting to insult you if casual games are your thing. That is wonderful! That doesn’t make you a “gamer” in my eyes. A gamer isn’t somebody that only plays Farmville or Angry Birds, I’m sorry. Now, if you play games like Uncharted, Tomb Raider, and then Farmville, I will consider you a gamer. =p I do not mean this as an insult. Of course, that is just how I see it.</p>
