              <h2>Upcoming PC games 2022 and beyond</h2>
              <p>
                All the upcoming PC games worth getting excited about, from
                Overwatch 2 to Redfall, and Gotham Knights to the highly
                anticipated Starfield and more

              <h2>Redfall</h2>
              <p>
                All we have to go from the trailer is that Redfall is a game
                about a bunch of misfits using their guns and weird powers
                against a horde of cultists and vampires. But boy did Arkane
                Studios sell the hell out of that premise. All four of the
                playable characters have cool designs and superpowers: there’s
                the lass with psychic powers that calls on a spectral elevator
                to launch friends into the sky, a sharpshooter with a raven
                friend, a nerd with a gatling gun filled with stakes, and a
                techie with a tiny robot friend. They make an immediate first
                impression and we can’t wait to see more.
